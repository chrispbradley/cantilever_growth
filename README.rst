Cantilever growth 

Building the example
====================

Instructions on how to configure and build with CMake::

  git clone https://github.com/OpenCMISS-Examples/cantilever_growth.git
  cd cantilever_growth 
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DOpenCMISS_INSTALL_ROOT=/path/to/opencmiss/install ../.
  make  # cmake --build . will also work here and is much more platform agnostic.

Running the example
===================

Explain how the example is run::

  ./src/fortran/cantilever_growth

or maybe it is a Python only example::

  source /path/to/opencmisslibs/install/virtaul_environments/oclibs_venv_pyXY_release/bin/activate
  python src/python/cantilever_growth.py

where the XY in the path are the Python major and minor versions respectively.
